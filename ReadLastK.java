     * Problem: Implement tail -n k
     *
     * The Task:
     *   Write a program that takes a filename and an integer k as input,
     *   and prints the last k lines of the file.
     *
     * Why it's crucial:
     *   Forces you to think about pointers and reading files efficiently
     *   (potentially from the end backwards if the file is huge) rather
     *   than blindly reading everything into a List.
     *
     * Java Focus:
     *   - RandomAccessFile (advanced approach)
     *   - Circular Buffer approach using LinkedList or Queue while reading forward
